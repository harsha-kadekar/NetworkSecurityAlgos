# NetworkSecurityAlgos
This has algorithms specific to network security like different classical ciphers. 
I have strated learning about cryptography. As I learn new cipher I will write corresponding ciphers, their deciphering
and finally their cryptanalysis. 

Currently I have following ciphers implemented
Caesor cipher.
Atbash cipher.

This is a dynamic linked library which has all these functions as exported. This repository also has one more solution which is a command 
line interface which acts as consumer of this dll. So each time I develop a function in dll i try to test using that consumer console
application.
